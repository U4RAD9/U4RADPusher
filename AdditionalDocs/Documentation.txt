u4rad.bat
- This is a batch script that runs the powershell script stored in Scripts as admin
- It bypasses the ExecutionPolicy of the system it is being run on
- After the Orthanc installation is finished, it will open a CMD tab which will close automatically after 5 seconds (it can be edited)
- In order to create the exe, download bat2execonverter from this link https://bat-to-exe-converter-x64.en.download.it/ and open it (it is a GUI)
- Create a x64 executable or x32 executable as needed 
- This file should NOT be packaged in the pusher zip file, only the EXE is required and the Scripts folder
- Keep this file somewhere safe

Scripts Folder

orthanc.exe
- This will be the orthanc installer
- Include the 32bit installer or the 64 bit installer as needed
- ALWAYS make sure that it is renamed to orthanc.exe

u4rad.ps1
- This is a powershell script
- $PSScriptRoot is the directory of the powershell script
- It creates a new JSON object that needs to be stored in the file orthanc.json
- Ensure that NOTHING is missing from this list (additional configuration can be added as needed)
- It writes this JSON object to orthanc.json in Program Files/Orthanc Server/Configuration/orthanc.json
- It places routing.lua in the configuration folder as well
- It then stops the orthanc service
- It edits a registry value which makes logs verbose (see Set-itemProperty function at the end of the file)
- It then starts the service again
- IMPORTANT: if you are not able to access orthanc on localhost:8042, go to services in the windows menu and manually restart the orthanc service

routing.lua
- This is an autorouting script that automatically sends any received instance from the client's local orthanc to the cloud orthanc
- It transcodes the file to JPEG-Lossless, in case the transfer syntax is to be changed, use any of the official dicom transfer syntaxes
- This file needs to be packaged with the pusher (it will be in the Scripts folder in the pusher zip file)


Things to do
- Get a certificate (look up how to digitally sign an exe) after final changes to the exe are done
- Use this certificate to verify the exe
- Test on x32 bit systems
